## R Markdown Assingment Reproducible Research Peer Graded Assingment 1

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 

Assignment 

This assignment will be described in multiple parts. You will need to write a report that answers the questions detailed below. Ultimately, you will need to complete the entire assignment in a single R markdown document that can be processed by knitr and be transformed into an HTML file.

Throughout your report make sure you always include the code that you used to generate the output you present. When writing code chunks in the R markdown document, always use echo = TRUE so that someone else will be able to read the code. This assignment will be evaluated via peer assessment so it is essential that your peer evaluators be able to review the code for your analysis.

For the plotting aspects of this assignment, feel free to use any plotting system in R (i.e., base, lattice, ggplot2)

Fork/clone the GitHub repository created for this assignment. You will submit this assignment by pushing your completed files into your forked repository on GitHub. The assignment submission will consist of the URL to your GitHub repository and the SHA-1 commit ID for your repository state.

NOTE: The GitHub repository also contains the dataset for the assignment so you do not have to download the data separately.




Show any code that is needed to

Load the data (i.e. read.csv())
Process/transform the data (if necessary) into a format suitable for your analysis


```{r LoadData}
setwd("C:/Coursera/ExploratoryDataAnalysis")
rdata <- read.csv('activity.csv', header = TRUE, sep = ",",
                  colClasses=c("numeric", "character", "numeric"))

#tidy the data or preprocess the data

#We convert the date field to Date class and interval field to Factor class.

rdata$date <- as.Date(rdata$date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
rdata$interval <- as.factor(rdata$interval)
str(rdata)

#What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

steps_per_day <- aggregate(steps ~ date, rdata, sum)
colnames(steps_per_day) <- c("date","steps")
head(steps_per_day)

# 1. Now we make a histogram of the total number of steps taken per day, plotted with appropriate bin interval.

library(ggplot2)

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

        labs(title="Average Daily Activity Pattern", x="Interval", y="Number of steps") +  
        theme_bw()

#Now, we find the 5-minute interval with the containing the maximum number of steps:

        steps_per_interval$steps),]

        steps_per_interval$steps),]

```

##Inputing missing values:

```{r pres, echo=FALSE}
#. Total number of missing values:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
